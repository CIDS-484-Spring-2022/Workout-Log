**Simple Workout Log**

**Description**

The purpose of this project is to create an application that can allow users to create workouts for each day of the week. This app will be a simple way to keep track of your weekly lifting schedule. The users will have full customization on what lifts they want to have added for each day and customize the number of sets and reps for each exercise. 

**Here's a list of tasks that the software can complete currently**

•	Start off with asking if you’re going to work out today or not. If you don’t plan on working out, a goodbye line will be presented with the current date. 
•	Give a list of exercises to add to your lift for the day. The program will then ask the user the number of sets, reps, and the amount of weight being used for each exercise. 
•	When you’ve completed your workout log for the day, the current date, the total amount of weight lifted, and all the information about each lift will be printed.
•	A text file with the output from the console is created. You can then add notes and save the file. 

**Motivation**

My motivation for creating this project is to create something simple, but also effective, that I can use daily. Having a workout log would be very beneficial for people who are looking to begin their fitness journey and don’t know where to start. It would also be great for people who are looking for a way to store their exercises somewhere where they can look back at it during their workout. 

**Project Details**

I created this project with Java as the language and used eclipse for the IDE. I figured this was a no brainer since this is what I’ve used in past classes, and because I implemented concepts from past classes. 

**Research Methods**

I used prior knowledge, notes, and projects from classes like Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures and Algorithms to help with concepts and implementation for this project. I also used some research using the web.

**Scope**

I am satisfied with the results that I got from this project. I was able to create a simple workout log application that I can use daily if I want. I also learned some new concepts and functions within the Java language and the eclipse environment. I got more experience using repositories and git bash. 

**Regrets/ Changes I Made Throughout the Semester**

Overall, I am very satisfied with my project. I feel like the features it offers were complex enough to challenge me, but the application was also simple enough to complete within the time frame. One original plan I had that I didn’t go through with was the use of an interface. I thought I could get the project working in the console, and then transfer it over to an interface with ease, but it’s not that simple. That’s why I implemented the use of the text file instead. The program still functions and serves a purpose.
