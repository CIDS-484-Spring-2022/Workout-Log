**Simple Workout Log**

**Description**
The purpose of this project is to create an application that can allow users to create workouts for each day of the week. This app will be a simple way to keep track of your weekly lifting schedule. The users will have full customization on what lifts they want to have added for each day and customize the number of sets and reps for each exercise. 

**Here's a list of tasks that the software is able to complete currently**
•	Start off with asking if you’re going to work out today or not. If you don’t plan on working out, a goodbye line will be presented with the current date. 
•	Give a list of exercises to add to your lift for the day. The program will then ask the user the number of sets, reps, and the amount of weight being used for each exercise. 
• Each exercise has detail on what the main muscle group is being worked.
• When an exercie is picked, a reminder/tip is given for that specific exercise. 
•	When you’ve completed your workout log for the day, the current date, the total amount of weight lifted, and all the information about each lift will be printed.
• THe program will also print your output to a text file. This way you can save your progress and look back at your stats. This also gives you the ability to add comments to your results. 

I believe this project would suit this class very well. It will involve some OOP concepts and some new concepts that I plan on learning on my own. This would be great experience.
I believe the concepts that will be used to create this are basic enough for students to learn, but also will be a great experience.

**Motivation**
My motivation for creating this project is to create something simple, but also effective, that I can use daily. Having a workout log would be very beneficial for people who are looking to begin their fitness journey and don’t know where to start. It would also be great for people who are looking for a way to store their exercises somewhere where they can look back at it during their workout. 
**
Project Details**
I plan on creating this project using Java with Eclipse as my IDE. This language and IDE are what I have used in classes prior to this one. I think Java is a great language to use for this project. Framework integration like Junit and TestNG and other plugins can be done easily. Also, many concepts I learned in previous classes can be implemented in this project. Using concepts like polymorphism and multi-level inheritance will be used to help create this project. Arrays will be used to put workouts together each day. 
Research Methods
I’ll use prior knowledge, notes, and projects from classes like Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures and Algorithms to help with concepts and implementation for this project. I’ll also do some research using the web if needed. 
Scope
As a student, I think completing this project would take some work, but is possible. Successfully developing a program like this would be a big
accomplishment for any student.



**Current Progress with the Project:**
•	Start off with asking if you’re going to work out today or not. If you don’t plan on working out, a goodbye line will be presented with the current date. 
•	Give a list of exercises to add to your lift for the day. THe program shows what muscle group each exercise works, and when an exercis is picked, A reminder/tip wil be displayed for that specific exercise. The program will then ask the user the number of sets, reps, and the amount of weight being used for each exercise. 
•	When you’ve completed your workout log for the day, the current date, the total amount of weight lifted, and all the information about each lift will be printed.

**What I Would Like to Add for the Final Submisison:**
•	An easier way to exit the program when you are shown the exercise options
•	Add anything else that I think would be beneficial to the application
